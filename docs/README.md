# Introduction

The BARC vehicle is based on a 1/10 scale remote control (RC) vehicle. The project can be divided into three sections: mechanical design, electrical design, and software design. The mechanical section focuses on the designs for the chassis deck and sensor mounts. The electrical section focuses on the sensor selection, the wiring, and the power distribution. The software section focuses on the data acquisition from sensors and the control algorithms, all within in Robotic Operating System (ROS) based framework.

## Mechanical design
The main RC mechanical components of the vehicle include the chassis, suspension, transmission system, and wheels. We designed an aluminum deck for the purpose of (a) holding the microcontroller and sensors and (b) protecting the on-board electronics.

## Electronic design
The on-board electronics move the vehicle. The standard electronic components in the RC car are listed in the table below.

| Component | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Servo | Set the steering angle |
| Electronic Speed Control (ESC) | Set the target rotation speed of the motor |
| Switch | Turn the ESC on / off |
| Brushless Motor | Move the car forward or backward, or brake
| Lithium polymer (LiPo) battery | Supply power to on-board electronics |
| Antenna | Get command from the remote control |
| Receiver | Relay command signal from antenna to servo and ESC |

## Software design
The BARC platform uses ROS, an open-source library and set of tools for programming robots. The architecture abstracts low level details, like timing, communication protocols, concurrency, and other processes by providing a simple programming paradigm with a well-written, easy-to-use set of application programming interfaces (APIs). The ROS infrastructure is build on the concepts of nodes, topics, messages. A short, a node is a computer program (i.e. le) that processes some data. That data is then packaged into a message format, and then published, or broadcast, onto a topic, for other nodes to listen to. In other words, ROS uses a many-to-many communication paradigm to decouple nodes, so that each node (or process) can be written independent of the others. For an in-depth explanation,

#### Charging the battery
We use a 2 Cell 7.4 V Turnigy LiPo Battery to power the RC car.

Be careful with the battery. For your safety:
* Never leave the battery charging while unattended.
* Never let the voltage drop below 6.0V
* Never charge the battery to over 8.4V (the charger should automatically stop charging at 8.4 V).
* Never charge the battery at higher than 5.0Amps
* When the car is not in use, donâ€™t leave the battery connected to the
ESC or the buck converter.
* If the battery starts smoking or gets on fire, treat it as a chemical fire

The video below provides a basic overview of how to charge the battery.

 When charging, note the following
* Use the three-pin balance port
* Use aligator clips to clip onto the battery terminals
* Set up the charging mode settings as 2S, 7.4V, 5.0A. (note, 2S means 2 cell)


#### Monitoring the voltage
We recommend using a battery cell checker to monitor the voltage of the battery.
Letting it drain too low could permanently damage the battery. These checkers have a
simple display to show the current voltage, and an alarm to sound when the voltage is too low.
There are many vendors that sell these checkers, here is [one](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__18588__HobbyKing_8482_Cell_Checker_with_Low_Voltage_Alarm_2S_8S_.html) that we use.

Below is a video about how to use one
